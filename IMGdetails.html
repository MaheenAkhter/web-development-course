<h2>Health</h2>
<p>The word health refers to a state of complete emotional and physical well-being. Healthcare exists to help people maintain this optimal state of health.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), healthcare costs in the United States were $3.5 trillion in 2017.

    However, despite this expenditure, people in the U.S. have a lower life expectancy than people in other developed countries. This is due to a variety of factors, including access to healthcare and lifestyle choices.Good health is central to handling stress and living a longer, more active life. In this article, we explain the meaning of good health, the types of health a person needs to consider, and how to preserve good health.</p>

<h2>What is health</h2>
<p>In 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined health with a phrase that modern authorities still apply.“Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”</p>
<p>In 1986, the WHO made further clarifications:</p>
      <p>“A resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.”</p>
      <h2>Healthy food</h2>
      <p>1-Vegetables and any subgroup such as beans, peas, starches, and those that are dark green, red or orange in color.</p>
      <p>2-Whole fruits</p>
      <p>3-Whole grains such as quinoa, corn, millet, and brown rice.</p>
      <p>4-Limited full-fat dairy.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.</p>
<p>Education, discipline that is concerned with methods of teaching and learning in schools or school-like environments as opposed to various nonformal and informal means of socialization (e.g., rural development projects and education through parent-child relationships).</p>
<img src="file:///C:/Users/Sulaman/Documents/Education1.jpg" width=30% length="50">
<p>A large number of empirical studies have revealed that increase in women's education boosts their wages and that returns to education for women are frequently larger than that of men. Increase in the level of female education improves human development outcomes such as child survival, health and schooling.</p>
<p>A woman is strong until she doesn’t want to be a weak. She can make each and everything come about as planned and improvise it accordingly. Education enhances a woman’s (and her partner and the family’s) level of health as it enhances her level of awareness regarding a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, women are bound to live a domestic life only, they are not allowed to get education as it has become the culture of some of the societies, as well as an increased likelihood to remain single, have no children, or have no formal marriage and alternatively, have increasing levels of long-term partnerships. A woman has a lot of things to manage but only if she is educated she will be managing them in a proper way, giving her child (infant) pre- learning which includes how to speak out the words like Mu Ma (Muma), Ba Ba (Baba). This is how she grooms her child and helps them by putting in proper way towards learning or getting education. Education can help a woman to participate in political and social sciences to raise their voices against the rights which have been stolen by others.</p>

<h2>Nature</h2>
<p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena</p>
<p>Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital for all known forms of life.[29] In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.[30] On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation.[31][32] Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.</p>

<p>A forest is made up of many layers. The main layers of all forest types are the forest floor, the understory, and the canopy. The emergent layer, above the canopy, exists in tropical rainforests. Each layer has a different set of plants and animals, depending upon the availability of sunlight, moisture, and food.Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change.</p>

<h2>Village life</h2>
<p>Pakistani village life is the traditional rural life of the people of Pakistan. People in village usually live in houses made of bricks, clay or mud. These typically have two or three rooms which house extended families.</p>
<p>People in village usually live in houses made of bricks, clay or mud. These typically have two or three rooms which house extended families. Although now they prefer living by making separate home for each family (nuclear units) but they don't live far away from their relatives, and they are extending their villages by making more homes. Due to geographical and other socioeconomic diversity, different regions have slightly different physical and social layout. For example, in Gongrani, Balochistan, people live in homes built within cliff-side caves that are connected by walkways.[1] Most of the villagers are farmers but other rural occupations include blacksmiths, hairdressers and tailorers, shepherds.[1]</p>
    <img src="file:///C:/Users/Sulaman/Documents/village2.jpg" width="30%" length="50%">
<p>Agriculture is the backbone of our national economy. More than seventy percent of our people live in the village. But, very little attention is given to uplift the condition of villages. Without taking solid and adequate measures for the improvement of village life, Pakistan cannot make progress.</p>
